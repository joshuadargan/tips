# Technical Interview Preparation Sessions (TIPS)
The purpose of TIPS is to give students experience and practice with behavorial and technical interviews (for software engineering interviews).

Students would be given two packets and sent into pairs to interview each other. One student would be interviewer A and the other interviewer B. 
One would interview the other first and then swap roles.
